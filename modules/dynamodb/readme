Yes, this script will allow you to store states, districts, mandals, and villages in a single DynamoDB table (v_regions) using a hierarchical, single-table design.

v_regions.tf

How it works:

Use the pk (partition key) and sk (sort key) to encode the hierarchy.
Example items:
State: pk = STATE#AP, sk = METADATA
District: pk = DISTRICT#GNT, sk = STATE#AP
Mandal: pk = MANDAL#GNT-1, sk = DISTRICT#GNT
Village: pk = VILLAGE#GNT-1-1, sk = MANDAL#GNT-1
You must ensure your application code writes items in this format.
This table structure is flexible and scalable for hierarchical administrative regions.
